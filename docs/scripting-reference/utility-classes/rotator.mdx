# Rotator

A container for rotation information. All rotation values are stored in degrees.

import { BasicType, Structs } from '@site/docs/components/_nanos.mdx';

:::info Tip

This structure is Open Sourced at [https://github.com/nanos-world/nanos-world-lua-lib](https://github.com/nanos-world/nanos-world-lua-lib). Feel free to push merge requests and suggest changes!

:::

:::info

Rotators are internally and automatically compressed, which reduces it's size in the network up to 90%. Their components are usually compressed into 1 byte each (with some exceptions which we need more precision).

## üëå Usage

```lua
local new_rotator = Rotator(-90, 153, 24.5)
```

## üéö Properties

| **Type** | **Name** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <BasicType.Number /> | Pitch | Rotation around the right axis (around Y axis), Looking up and down (0=Straight Ahead, +Up, -Down) |
| <BasicType.Number /> | Yaw | Rotation around the up axis (around Z axis), Running in circles 0=East, +North, -South. |
| <BasicType.Number /> | Roll | Rotation around the forward axis (around X axis), Tilting your head, 0=Straight, +Clockwise, -CCW. |

## ‚è© Functions

:::tip

**Note:** This structure supports `+`, `-`, `*` and `tostring` operations.

| **Returns** | **Name** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <Structs.Vector /> | **`GetForwardVector()`** | Get the forward (X) unit direction vector from this component, in world space. |
| <Structs.Vector /> | **`RotateVector(vector)`** | Rotate a vector rotated by this rotator. |
|  | **`Normalize()`** | In-place normalize, removes all winding and creates the ‚Äúshortest route‚Äù rotation. |
| <Structs.Vector /> | **`UnrotateVector(vector)`** | Returns the vector rotated by the inverse of this rotator. |
| <Structs.Quat /> | **`Quaternion()`** | Get Rotation as a quaternion. |
| <Structs.Rotator /> | **`GetNormalized()`** | Returns a new Rotator normalized. |
| <BasicType.Boolean /> | **`IsNearlyZero(tolerance)`** | Checks whether rotator is near to zero within a specified tolerance |
| <BasicType.Boolean /> | **`IsZero()`** | Checks whether all components of the rotator are exactly zero |


## ‚è© Static Functions

| **Returns** | **Name** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <Structs.Rotator /> | `Random(roll)` | Generates a random rotation, with optional random roll |
