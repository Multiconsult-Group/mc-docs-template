So long has passed since we started developing nanos world. In late 2017 we started digging about this ambitious idea, we dreamed of creating a seamless open world sandbox gaming experience without the limitations of reverse engineering games such as Just Cause 3 or Grand Theft Auto. So we decided to create a game from scratch, but only in mid 2019 we started working hard, it was really a very enthusiastic idea, but after a lot of blood, love and sweat we are getting there! ðŸ¥°

## Alpha 1.0.0!

And we're finally reaching the long-awaited Alpha announcement! Lots of things have happened, lots of iterations have been done (and lots will come ðŸ˜œ) and thanks to all the support from our community and your feedback, we're getting closer and closer to releasing nanos world!

The official Alpha 1.0.0 update will come with tons of scripting and gaming news!

## Steam!

Along with the Alpha announcement, we have LOTS of other surprises! As you may have noticed, now [nanos world is on STEAM](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1686450/nanos_world)!!! Itch was very good and helped us a lot at the time, and we will always be grateful that their service and support has always been free! But then we made the decision to take this next step moving to the biggest game platform!

## New Website!

We've created a brand new website which contains a lot of information about nanos world which will help us marketing it! If you didn't yet, please take a look at [https://nanos.world](https://nanos.world)!

## Lot of news to come!

In the meantime since the last update (0.73.0), we've accumulated **A LOT** of new content for nanos world. Most couldn't be released as we were working alongside the Steam integration.

### ðŸ”¢ Versions

![](/img/blog/alpha/betas.jpg)

With the arrival of Steam, there will be several changes to how we distribute updates! We will now have two branches `stable/latest` and `bleeding-edge`, we intend to keep the default branch as stable as possible, while working in upcoming content in the *bleeding-edge* branch.

By default all testers will have access to *bleeding-edge* to be able to help us testing the new features before releasing them officially! Also in the docs we are going to have two versions which represent each of the branch!

:::info

The version **a1.0.0** is already present in *bleeding-edge* branch and will come to *stable* as soon as possible! Really soon we will start publishing the full changelog of that!

### ðŸ§ª Testers

With this new stage we decided to start fresh and restart our Tester subscriptions. Please check out [Sign Up for Alpha Testing](/docs/signing-up-alpha) for more information on how to become a Tester.

If you already a Tester, please reach us in discord so you can get a Steam key. We will prioritize active members in the community!

### ðŸ”® Future plans

We've also created a new [Roadmap](/docs/roadmap) page with all our plans and redirecting to our official Roadmap boards!

In the coming weeks we will gradually start distributing some Steam Keys and as soon we will release the first Steam update with a lot of new content!

Stay tuned! And thank you so much for all your support!
