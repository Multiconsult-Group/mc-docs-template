Some time ago, we released our brand new docs version written in Markdown! It was using GitBook services and hosting, the jump was big from the previous version written in Sphinx.

Since then we are exploring the market possibilities, we've tested ReadMe, ReType and MdBook as well.

And then finally we've found Docusaurus! A open source Docs which allows a lot of customization, and even has some amazing built-in features that we can use! This is a next jump towards the success!

Check out the Key Features added in the full post!

Now our docs can have versions! In advance to some plans we have in mind, we will be able to display different versions to be read!

### Multi-language

We now support multi-languages! The translation is provided by Crowdin, a cloud-based solution that streamlines localization! Everyone can collaborate in translating the pages, and even the blog posts!
